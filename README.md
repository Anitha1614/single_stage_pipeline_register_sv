# single_stage_pipeline_register_sv
Single-stage SystemVerilog pipeline register implementing a standard valid/ready handshake. The design correctly handles backpressure, prevents data loss or duplication, and resets to a clean empty state. Includes synthesizable RTL and a simple testbench suitable for ASIC/RTL design verification.
